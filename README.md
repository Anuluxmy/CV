A friendly and ambitious person with successful sales experience and a positive, confident approach. Able to work well both in teams and on own initiative. Graduated from Makers Academy, a highly selective coding bootcamp based in London. Looking for junior developer roles where I can apply and develop my skills learnt from Makers.

## Skills

**Communication**

Able to communicate effectively with a wide range of people, by showing interest and carefully listening to their needs. Consistently provided good customer service in my job. Also been awarded for giving excellent customer service from customer feedback survey.

**Analytical Mind**

I love learning new things constantly. I was able to demonstrate this during my time at Makers when I worked with new technologies (Node.js, Python) and had to pick them up within a short space of time.
